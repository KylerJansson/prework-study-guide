# Prework Study Guide Webpage

This webpage was made as a study guide for the things I learned in Prework. I built this weppage to help me learn HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. In console it will tell you what to study randomly. I learned how to structure a webpage using HTML, change the look using CSS, and gave the webpage utility adding variables and functions.
